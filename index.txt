I'm a freshman of the spring 2020 batch at northwest Missouri state university, pursuing my master's in Applied Computer Science.

I’m from Nizamabad, India.  I had Pursued my bachelor of technology from JB Institute of Engineering and Technology in 2019 with a major as “Information Technology.”I have knowledge on Mysql and also created some basic tables in the Database during my bachelor's. My hobbies are playing cricket, volleyball, and love listening to music. I was a member of the college volleyball team. And also participated in some inter-college tournaments.

I hope this master’s will help me in gaining in-depth knowledge in front-end and back-end development and also help me to achieve my career goal as “FULL STACK DEVELOPER”.
